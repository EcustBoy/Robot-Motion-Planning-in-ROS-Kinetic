# Robot-Motion-Planning-in-ROS-Kinetic
Implementation of D* and A* path planning algorithm along with dynamic window approach. This allows TurtleBots to move from point A to point B whilst avoiding both dynamic and static obstacles in unknown and known environments. Has been tested in several environments, and tested to guide crowds in evacuation scenarios.
